Special requirements:
  
  In order to use the location features for this app on an emulator, you must
  use the ddms view in eclipse to set a location for the emulator. If you don't
  set a location you won't be able to use the location features even if they 
  are turned on. (Also, the emulator doesn't support the use of network 
  location, so gps must be turned on)
  
  All that said, the app will work fine on a normal device.
