				<h2>About Auto Response</h2>
				AutoResponse lets you customize your phone to be aware of it's environment. </br>
				You define sets of conditions and how you would like your phone to respond </br>
				if these conditions are met. </br>
				</br>
				For example, the conditions might be that is is between 8am and 5pm on a </br>
				weekday and your location matches your office location. In this case, you </br>
				might configure the response to put your phone on silent mode so you are  </br>
				not inturrupted.
